<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 This is the entry point to a series of electronic textbooks on
    various aspects of <i>Software Foundations</i>, the mathematical
    underpinnings of reliable software.  Topics in the series include
    basic concepts of logic, computer-assisted theorem proving, the
    Rocq prover, functional programming, operational semantics, logics
    and techniques for reasoning about programs, static type systems,
    property-based random testing, and verification of practical C
    code.  The exposition is intended for a broad range of readers,
    from advanced undergraduates to PhD students and researchers.  No
    specific background in logic or programming languages is assumed,
    though a degree of mathematical maturity will be helpful.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    The principal novelty of the series is that it is one hundred
    percent formalized and machine-checked: each text is literally a
    script for Rocq.  The books are intended to be read alongside (or
    inside) an interactive session with Rocq.  All the details in the
    text are fully formalized in Rocq, and most of the exercises are
    designed to be worked using Rocq.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    The files in each book are organized into a sequence of core
    chapters, covering about one semester's worth of material and
    organized into a coherent linear narrative, plus a number of
    "offshoot" chapters covering additional topics.  All the core
    chapters are suitable for both upper-level undergraduate and
    graduate students.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    This book, <i>Logical Foundations</i>, lays groundwork for the others,
    introducing the reader to the basic ideas of functional
    programming, constructive logic, and the Rocq prover.

<a id="lab2"></a><h1 class="section">Overview</h1>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Building reliable software is hard -- really hard.  The scale and
    complexity of modern systems, the number of people involved, and
    the range of demands placed on them make it challenging to build
    software that is even more-or-less correct, much less 100%
    correct.  At the same time, the increasing degree to which
    information processing is woven into every aspect of society
    greatly amplifies the cost of bugs and insecurities.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Computer scientists and software engineers have responded to these
    challenges by developing a host of techniques for improving
    software reliability, ranging from recommendations about managing
    software projects teams (e.g., extreme programming) to design
    philosophies for libraries (e.g., model-view-controller,
    publish-subscribe, etc.) and programming languages (e.g.,
    object-oriented programming, functional programming, ...)
    to mathematical techniques for
    specifying and reasoning about properties of software and tools
    for helping validate these properties.  The <i>Software Foundations</i>
    series is focused on this last set of tools.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    This volume weaves together three conceptual threads:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    (A) basic tools from <i>logic</i> for making and justifying precise
        claims about programs;

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    (B) the use of <i>proof assistants</i> (or <i>provers</i>) to construct
        rigorous logical arguments;

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    (C) <i>functional programming</i>, both as a method of programming that
        simplifies reasoning about programs and as a bridge between
        programming and logic. 
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a id="lab3"></a><h2 class="section">Logic</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Logic is the field of study whose subject matter is <i>proofs</i> --
    unassailable arguments for the truth of particular propositions.
    Volumes have been written about the central role of logic in
    computer science.  Manna and Waldinger called it "the calculus of
    computer science," while Halpern et al.'s paper <i>On the Unusual
    Effectiveness of Logic in Computer Science</i> catalogs scores of
    ways in which logic offers critical tools and insights.  Indeed,
    they observe that, "As a matter of fact, logic has turned out to
    be significantly more effective in computer science than it has
    been in mathematics.  This is quite remarkable, especially since
    much of the impetus for the development of logic during the past
    one hundred years came from mathematics."

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    In particular, the fundamental tools of <i>inductive proof</i> are
    ubiquitous in all of computer science.  You have surely seen them
    before, perhaps in a course on discrete math or analysis of
    algorithms, but in this course we will examine them more deeply
    than you have probably done so far. 
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a id="lab4"></a><h2 class="section">Proof Assistants</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 The flow of ideas between logic and computer science has not been
    unidirectional: CS has also made important contributions to logic.
    One of these has been the development of software tools for
    helping construct proofs of logical propositions.  These tools
    fall into two broad categories:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> <i>Automated theorem provers</i> provide "push-button" operation:
         you give them a proposition and they return either <i>true</i> or
         <i>false</i> (or, sometimes, <i>don't know: ran out of time</i>).
         Although their reasoning capabilities are still limited,
         they have matured tremendously in recent decades and
         are used now in a multitude of settings.  Examples of such
         tools include SAT solvers, SMT solvers, and model checkers.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> <i>Proof assistants</i> are hybrid tools that automate the more
         routine aspects of building proofs while depending on human
         guidance for more difficult aspects.  Widely used proof
         assistants include Isabelle, Agda, Twelf, ACL2, PVS, F*,
         HOL4, Lean, and Rocq, among many others.

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    This course is based around Rocq, a proof assistant that has been
    under development since 1983 and has attracted a large community
    of users in both research and industry.  Rocq provides a rich
    environment for interactive development of machine-checked formal
    reasoning.  The kernel of the Rocq system is a simple
    proof-checker, which guarantees that only correct deduction steps
    are ever performed.  On top of this kernel, the Rocq environment
    provides high-level facilities for proof development, including a
    large library of common definitions and lemmas, powerful tactics
    for constructing complex proofs semi-automatically, and a
    special-purpose programming language for defining new
    proof-automation tactics for specific situations.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Rocq has been a critical enabler for a huge variety of work across
    computer science and mathematics:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> As a <i>platform for modeling programming languages</i>, it has
      become a standard tool for researchers who need to describe and
      reason about complex language definitions.  It has been used,
      for example, to check the security of the JavaCard platform,
      obtaining the highest level of common criteria certification,
      and for formal specifications of the x<sub>86</sub> and LLVM instruction
      sets and programming languages such as C.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> As an <i>environment for developing formally certified software
      and hardware</i>, Rocq has been used, for example, to build
      CompCert, a fully-verified optimizing compiler for C, and
      CertiKOS, a fully verified hypervisor, for proving the
      correctness of subtle algorithms involving floating point
      numbers, and as the basis for CertiCrypt, FCF, and SSProve,
      which are frameworks for proving cryptographic algorithms secure.
      It is also being used to build verified implementations of the
      open-source RISC-V processor architecture.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> As a <i>realistic environment for functional programming with
      dependent types</i>, it has inspired numerous innovations.  For
      example, Hoare Type Theory embeds reasoning about
      "pre-conditions" and "post-conditions" (an extension of the
      <i>Hoare Logic</i> we will see later in this course) in Rocq.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> As a <i>proof assistant for higher-order logic</i>, it has been used
      to validate a number of important results in mathematics.  For
      example, its ability to include complex computations inside
      proofs made it possible to develop the first formally verified
      proof of the 4-color theorem.  This proof had previously been
      controversial among mathematicians because it required checking
      a large number of configurations using a program. In the Rocq
      formalization, everything is checked, including the correctness
      of the computational part.  More recently, an even more massive
      effort led to a Rocq formalization of the Feit-Thompson Theorem,
      the first major step in the classification of finite simple
      groups.  
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a id="lab5"></a><h2 class="section">Functional Programming</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 The term <i>functional programming</i> refers both to a collection of
    programming idioms that can be used in almost any programming
    language and to a family of programming languages designed to
    emphasize these idioms, including Haskell, OCaml, Standard ML,
    F#, Scala, Scheme, Racket, Common Lisp, Clojure, Erlang, F*,
    and Rocq.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Functional programming has been developed over many decades --
    indeed, its roots go back to Church's lambda-calculus, which was
    invented in the 1930s, well <i>before</i> the first electronic
    computers!  But since the early '90s it has enjoyed a surge of
    interest among industrial engineers and language designers,
    playing a key role in high-value systems at companies like Jane
    Street Capital, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, and Ericsson.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    The most basic tenet of functional programming is that, as much as
    possible, computation should be <i>pure</i>, in the sense that the only
    effect of execution should be to produce a result: it should be
    free from <i>side effects</i> such as I/O, assignments to mutable
    variables, redirecting pointers, etc.  For example, whereas an
    <i>imperative</i> sorting function might take a list of numbers and
    rearrange its pointers to put the list in order, a pure sorting
    function would take the original list and return a <i>new</i> list
    containing the same numbers in sorted order.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    A significant benefit of this style of programming is that it
    makes programs easier to understand and reason about.  If every
    operation on a data structure yields a new data structure, leaving
    the old one intact, then there is no need to worry about how that
    structure is being shared and whether a change by one part of the
    program might break an invariant relied on by another part of the
    program.  These considerations are particularly critical in
    concurrent systems, where every piece of mutable state that is
    shared between threads is a potential source of pernicious bugs.
    Indeed, a large part of the recent interest in functional
    programming in industry is due to its simpler behavior in the
    presence of concurrency.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Another reason for the current excitement about functional
    programming is related to the first: functional programs are often
    much easier to parallelize and physically distribute than their
    imperative counterparts.  If running a computation has no effect
    other than producing a result, then it does not matter <i>where</i> it
    is run.  Similarly, if a data structure is never modified
    destructively, then it can be copied freely, across cores or
    across the network.  Indeed, the "Map-Reduce" idiom, which lies at
    the heart of massively distributed query processors like Hadoop
    and is used by Google to index the entire web is a classic example
    of functional programming.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    For purposes of this course, functional programming has yet
    another significant attraction: it serves as a bridge between
    logic and computer science.  Indeed, Rocq itself can be viewed as a
    combination of a small but extremely expressive functional
    programming language plus a set of tools for stating and proving
    logical assertions.  Moreover, when we come to look more closely,
    we find that these two sides of Rocq are actually aspects of the
    very same underlying machinery -- i.e., <i>proofs are programs</i>.  
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a id="lab6"></a><h2 class="section">Rocq vs. Coq</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Until 2025, the Rocq prover was known as Coq. According to the
    official webpage, "The name 'Coq' referenced the Calculus of
    Constructions (CoC), the foundational system it is based on, as
    well as one of its creators, Thierry Coquand. Additionally, it
    paid homage to the French national symbol, the rooster.  The new
    name, 'the Rocq Prover', honors Inria Rocquencourt, the original
    site where the prover was developed. It also alludes to the
    mythological bird Roc (or Rokh), symbolizing strength and not so
    disconnected to a rooster. Furthermore, the name conveys a sense
    of solidity, and its unintended connection to music adds a
    pleasant resonance."

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    The current release of Software Foundations is still in a
    transitional state, and you will see references to both Coq and
    Rocq.

    for any separate Rocq installation.  This method is recommended for
    most Software Foundations readers.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> Install Docker from <a href="https://www.docker.com/get-started/"><span class="inlineref" <a href='https://www.docker.com/get-started/</span></a>'>https://www.docker.com/get-started/</span></a></a>or
      make sure your existing installation is up to date.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Make sure Docker is running.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Install VSCode from <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com"><span class="inlineref" <a href='https://code.visualstudio.com</span></a>'>https://code.visualstudio.com</span></a></a>and start it
      running.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Install VSCode's Dev Containers Extension from
      <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers"><span class="inlineref" <a href='https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers</span></a>'>https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers</span></a></a>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

      (Note that this extension only works with the official version
      of VSCode, not with some VSCode forks like VsCodium.)

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Set up a directory for this SF volume by downloading the
      provided <span class="inlinecode">.<span class="id" title="var">tgz</span></span> file.  Besides the <span class="inlinecode">.<span class="id" title="var">v</span></span> file for each chapter,
      this directory will contain a <span class="inlinecode">.<span class="id" title="var">devcontainer</span></span> subdirectory with
      instructions for VSCode about where to find an appropriate
      Docker image and a <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">_CoqProject</span></span> file, whose presence triggers
      the VSCoq extension.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> In VSCode, use <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">File</span></span> <span class="inlinecode">&gt;</span> <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="keyword">Open</span></span> <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">Folder</span></span> to open the new directory.
      VSCode should ask you whether you want to run the project in the
      associated Docker container.  (If it does not ask you, you can
      open the command palette by pressing F<sub>1</sub> and run the command “Dev
      Containers: Reopen in Container”.)

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

      This step may take some time.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Check that VSCoq is working by double-clicking the file
      <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">Basics.v</span></span> from the list on the left (you should see a blinking
      cursor in the window that opens; if not you can click in that
      window to select it), and pressing <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">alt</span>+<span class="id" title="var">downarrow</span></span> (on MacOS,
      <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">control</span>+<span class="id" title="var">option</span>+<span class="id" title="var">downarrow</span></span>) a few times.  You should see the
      cursor move through the file and the region above the cursor get
      highlighted.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> If VSCoq does not work and you receive an error indicating that
        <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">vscoqtop</span></span> was not found, open a new terminal in the container
        (you can do this by opening the command palette and running the

        <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">which</span></span> <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">vscoqtop</span></span>. This should print the path to the VSCoq
        installation inside the container. Copy this path
        and paste it into the “VSCoq: Path” textbox in the
        VSCoq extension settings (accessible via the gear icon on
        the VSCoq extension page in VSCode), then reload your window.

<a id="lab11"></a><h2 class="section">Alternative Installation Methods</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 If you prefer, there are several other ways to use Rocq. You will need:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> A current installation of Rocq, available from the Rocq home
      page (<a href="https://rocq-prover.org/install"><span class="inlineref" <a href='https://rocq-prover.org/install</span></a>).'>https://rocq-prover.org/install</span></a>).</a> The "Rocq Platform"
      offers the easiest installation experience for most people,
      especially on Windows.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> An IDE for interacting with Rocq.  There are several choices:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> <i>VsCoq</i> is an extension for Visual Studio Code that offers a
          simple interface via a familiar IDE.  This option is the
          recommended default.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

          VsCoq can be used as an ordinary IDE or it can be combined
          with Docker (see below) for a lightweight installation
          experience.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> <i>Proof General</i> is an Emacs-based IDE.  It tends to be
          preferred by users who are already comfortable with Emacs.
          It requires a separate installation (google "Proof General",
          but generally all you need to do is <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">M</span>-<span class="id" title="var">x</span></span> <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">package</span>-<span class="id" title="var">list</span>-<span class="id" title="var">packages</span></span>,
          then select the <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">proof</span>-<span class="id" title="var">general</span></span> package from the list and
          hit the <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">i</span></span> key for install, then hit the <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">x</span></span> key for execute).

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

          There are only a few commands you need to know to use ProofGeneral
          effectively. They are:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">C</span>-<span class="id" title="var">c</span></span> <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">C</span>-<span class="id" title="var">n</span></span>: send the next command to Rocq.

<li> <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">C</span>-<span class="id" title="var">c</span></span> <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">C</span>-<span class="id" title="var">RET</span></span>: submit everything up to the current cursor location to
            Rocq for processing.

</li>
<li> <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">C</span>-<span class="id" title="var">c</span></span> <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">C</span>-.</span>: move the cursor to the end of the last command which has
            been processed by Rocq.

</li>
<li> <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">C</span>-<span class="id" title="var">c</span></span> <span class="inlinecode">.</span>: toggle "electric terminator mode". When this mode is
            turned on, simply typing a period will send the current command to
            Rocq (normally you have to type a period and then type <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">C</span>-<span class="id" title="var">c</span></span> <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">C</span>-<span class="id" title="var">n</span></span>).

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
</ul>
          Adventurous users of Rocq within Emacs may want to check out
          extensions such as <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">company</span>-<span class="id" title="var">coq</span></span> and <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">control</span>-<span class="id" title="var">lock</span></span>.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> <i>RocqIDE</i> is a simpler stand-alone IDE.  It is distributed with
          the Rocq Platform, so it should be available once you have Rocq
          installed.  It can also be compiled from scratch, but on some
          platforms this may involve installing additional packages for GUI
          libraries and such.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a id="lab12"></a><h2 class="section">Exercises</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Each chapter includes numerous exercises.  Each is marked with a
    "star rating," which can be interpreted as follows:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> One star: easy exercises that underscore points in the text
         and that, for most readers, should take only a minute or two.
         Get in the habit of working these as you reach them.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Two stars: straightforward exercises (five or ten minutes).

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Three stars: exercises requiring a bit of thought (ten
         minutes to half an hour).

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Four and five stars: more difficult exercises (half an hour
         and up).

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Those using SF in a classroom setting should note that the autograder
    assigns extra points to harder exercises:
<br/>
<span class="inlinecode">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 <span class="id" title="var">star</span>  = 1 <span class="id" title="var">point</span><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 <span class="id" title="var">stars</span> = 2 <span class="id" title="var">points</span><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 <span class="id" title="var">stars</span> = 3 <span class="id" title="var">points</span><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 <span class="id" title="var">stars</span> = 6 <span class="id" title="var">points</span><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 <span class="id" title="var">stars</span> = 10 <span class="id" title="var">points</span>
</span>
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Some exercises are marked "advanced," and some are marked
    "optional."  Doing just the non-optional, non-advanced exercises
    should provide good coverage of the core material.  Optional
    exercises provide a bit of extra practice with key concepts and
    introduce secondary themes that may be of interest to some
    readers.  Advanced exercises are for readers who want an extra
    challenge and a deeper cut at the material.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

   <span class="loud"> <i>Please do not post solutions to the exercises in a public place</i>. </span>
    Software Foundations is widely used both for self-study and for
    university courses.  Having solutions easily available makes it
    much less useful for courses, which typically have graded homework
    assignments.  We especially request that readers not post
    solutions to the exercises anyplace where they can be found by
    search engines.

<a id="lab13"></a><h2 class="section">Downloading the Rocq Files</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 A tar file containing the full sources for the "release version"
    of this book (as a collection of Rocq scripts and HTML files) is
    available at <a href="https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu"><span class="inlineref" <a href='https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu</span></a>.'>https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu</span></a>.</a>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    If you are using the book as part of a class, your professor may
    give you access to a locally modified version of the files; you
    should use that one instead of the public release version, so that
    you get any local updates during the semester.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 If you plan to use these materials in your own teaching, or if you
    are using software foundations for self study and are finding
    things you'd like to help add or improve, your contributions are
    welcome!  You are warmly invited to join the private SF git repo.

    In order to keep the legalities simple and to have a single point
    of responsibility in case the need should ever arise to adjust the
    license terms, sublicense, etc., we ask all contributors (i.e.,
    everyone with access to the developers' repository) to assign
    copyright in their contributions to the appropriate "author of
    record," as follows:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> I hereby assign copyright in my past and future contributions
        to the Software Foundations project to the Author of Record of
        each volume or component, to be licensed under the same terms
        as the rest of Software Foundations.  I understand that, at
        present, the Authors of Record are as follows: For Volumes 1
        and 2, known until 2016 as "Software Foundations" and from
        2016 as (respectively) "Logical Foundations" and "Programming
        Foundations," and for Volume 4, "QuickChick: Property-Based
        Testing in Rocq," the Author of Record is Benjamin C. Pierce.
        For Volume 3, "Verified Functional Algorithms," and volume 5,
        "Verifiable C," the Author of Record is Andrew W. Appel. For
        Volume 6, "Separation Logic Foundations," the author of record
        is Arthur Chargueraud. For components outside of designated
        volumes (e.g., typesetting and grading tools and other
        software infrastructure), the Author of Record is Benjamin C.
        Pierce.
